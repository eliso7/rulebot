  # Basic Combat
  - question: "What happens when I cast Lightning Bolt targeting a creature with hexproof?"
    expected_answer: "Lightning Bolt cannot target a creature with hexproof. Hexproof prevents the creature from being targeted by spells or abilities your opponents control. The spell will fail to have a legal target and will be countered by game rules."
    category: "targeting"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_cards: ["Lightning Bolt"]
    key_rules: ["702.11"]

  - question: "Can I target my own creatures with Lightning Bolt?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, you can target your own creatures with Lightning Bolt. Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target, and you control your own creatures, so they are legal targets."
    category: "targeting"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_cards: ["Lightning Bolt"]

  - question: "Does first strike damage happen before regular combat damage?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, first strike damage happens in the first strike combat damage step, which occurs before the regular combat damage step. Creatures with first strike deal their damage first."
    category: "combat"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["702.7"]

  - question: "If I attack with a 5/5 and my opponent blocks with a 2/2, what happens?"
    expected_answer: "Your 5/5 creature will deal 5 damage to the 2/2, and the 2/2 will deal 2 damage to your 5/5. The 2/2 will be destroyed, and your 5/5 will survive with 2 damage marked on it until the end of the turn."
    category: "combat"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["510.1"]

  - question: "Can I block a creature with trample with multiple creatures?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, you can block a creature with trample with multiple creatures. The attacking player must assign at least lethal damage to each blocking creature in order before assigning any remaining damage to the defending player."
    category: "combat"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["702.19b"]

  - question: "If a creature has flying, can it be blocked by a creature with reach?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, a creature with flying can be blocked by a creature with reach. Reach specifically allows a creature to block creatures with flying."
    category: "combat"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["702.17a"]

  - question: "What happens if a creature attacks and the defending player has no creatures to block?"
    expected_answer: "If the defending player has no creatures to block, the attacking creature is considered unblocked and will deal its combat damage directly to the defending player."
    category: "combat"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["509.2"]

  - question: "How does deathtouch work with trample?"
    expected_answer: "When a creature with deathtouch and trample is blocked, its controller only needs to assign 1 point of damage to each blocking creature to be considered lethal damage. The remaining damage can then be assigned to the defending player."
    category: "combat"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["702.2b", "702.19b"]

  - question: "Can a creature with summoning sickness block?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, a creature can block the turn it comes under your control. Summoning sickness only prevents it from attacking or using abilities with the tap or untap symbol."
    category: "summoning_sickness"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["302.6"]

  # Intermediate Rules
  - question: "If I control Doubling Season and play a planeswalker, how many loyalty counters does it enter with?"
    expected_answer: "The planeswalker will enter with double its printed loyalty counters due to Doubling Season's replacement effect. For example, a planeswalker that normally enters with 3 loyalty would enter with 6."
    category: "replacement_effects"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_cards: ["Doubling Season"]
    key_rules: ["614.1c", "306.5b"]

  - question: "Can I activate abilities of creatures with summoning sickness?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, you can activate most abilities of creatures with summoning sickness. Summoning sickness only prevents creatures from attacking and using abilities with the tap symbol or untap symbol in their cost."
    category: "summoning_sickness"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["302.6"]

  - question: "What happens if I copy a spell with X in its mana cost?"
    expected_answer: "When you copy a spell with X in its mana cost, the copy uses the same value of X that was chosen when the original spell was cast. You don't pay the mana cost again for the copy."
    category: "copying"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["707.2", "107.3i"]

  - question: "If my opponent casts a spell that says 'counter target spell', can I use a spell that gives my creature hexproof in response to save my creature spell?"
    expected_answer: "No, giving your creature on the battlefield hexproof will not save your creature *spell* on the stack. Hexproof only protects permanents on the battlefield. You would need a spell that makes your spell unable to be countered, or another way to counter their counterspell."
    category: "targeting"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["115.1c", "702.11c"]

  - question: "What is the difference between an activated ability and a triggered ability?"
    expected_answer: "An activated ability is written in the format '[Cost]: [Effect]' and can be activated by a player whenever they have priority. A triggered ability uses the words 'When,' 'Whenever,' or 'At' and automatically goes on the stack when its trigger condition is met."
    category: "abilities"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["602.1", "603.1"]

  - question: "Can I respond to a planeswalker's loyalty ability activation?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, you can respond. Activating a loyalty ability uses the stack. After the ability is put on the stack, but before it resolves, players receive priority to cast spells and activate other abilities."
    category: "planeswalkers"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["606.1"]

  - question: "If a card says 'destroy all creatures,' does it destroy indestructible creatures?"
    expected_answer: "No, an indestructible creature cannot be destroyed by effects that say 'destroy'. It can still be removed from the battlefield by other means, such as being exiled, being sacrificed, or having its toughness reduced to 0 or less."
    category: "keyword_abilities"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["702.12b"]

  # Stack and Priority
  - question: "Can I respond to my own spell?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, you can respond to your own spell. After you cast a spell, each player (starting with you) gets priority to cast spells or activate abilities before the original spell resolves."
    category: "stack"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["117.3c"]

  - question: "What happens to a spell if its target becomes illegal?"
    expected_answer: "If all targets of a spell become illegal, the spell is countered by game rules and has no effect. If only some targets become illegal, the spell resolves but only affects the remaining legal targets."
    category: "targeting"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["608.2b"]

  - question: "If multiple triggered abilities I control trigger at the same time, in what order do they go on the stack?"
    expected_answer: "If you control multiple triggered abilities that have triggered since the last time a player received priority, you choose the order to put them on the stack. This is often referred to as 'stacking your triggers'."
    category: "stack"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["603.3b"]

  - question: "What does it mean to 'hold priority'?"
    expected_answer: "After you cast a spell or activate an ability, you receive priority again. 'Holding priority' means you perform another action (like casting another spell) before passing priority to your opponent, so your second spell will resolve before they get a chance to act on your first."
    category: "priority"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["117.3c"]

  - question: "Does sacrificing a creature as a cost use the stack?"
    expected_answer: "No, paying costs does not use the stack. Sacrificing a creature as part of a cost happens immediately when you activate the ability or cast the spell. No player can respond to the sacrifice itself, only to the spell or ability that is now on the stack."
    category: "costs"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["601.2h"]

  # Complex Interactions
  - question: "How does cascade work with split cards?"
    expected_answer: "When you cascade, you compare the mana value of the spell with cascade to the mana values of the cards you exile. For a split card, you use its combined mana value while in the library. If the split card's mana value is less, you can cast either half without paying its mana cost."
    category: "cascade"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_rules: ["702.85", "709.4"]

  - question: "Can I choose the same mode twice for a modal spell like Cryptic Command?"
    expected_answer: "No, unless the spell specifically says otherwise (e.g., 'Choose two. You may choose the same mode more than once'). Modal spells like Cryptic Command require you to choose different modes."
    category: "modal_spells"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_cards: ["Cryptic Command"]
    key_rules: ["700.2"]

  - question: "I cast Wrath of God. My opponent has a Selfless Spirit. In response, they sacrifice it. Do their creatures survive?"
    expected_answer: "Yes. In response to Wrath of God, your opponent sacrifices their Selfless Spirit. The Spirit's ability resolves first, giving their other creatures indestructible. Then, Wrath of God resolves and fails to destroy the now indestructible creatures."
    category: "stack"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_cards: ["Wrath of God", "Selfless Spirit"]
    key_rules: ["117.7"]

  - question: "How does Yawgmoth's Will interact with casting spells from my graveyard?"
    expected_answer: "Yawgmoth's Will allows you to play cards from your graveyard as though they were in your hand. A crucial part of the effect is that if a card would be put into your graveyard from anywhere this turn, it is exiled instead. This prevents you from repeatedly casting the same card."
    category: "graveyard"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_cards: ["Yawgmoth's Will"]
    key_rules: ["self-replacement effect on card"]

  - question: "What is the difference between a copy of a permanent spell (like Clone) and a token copy (like from Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker)?"
    expected_answer: "A card like Clone becomes a copy of a creature as it enters the battlefield; its own characteristics are overwritten by the copiable values of the chosen creature. A token copy created by an ability like Kiki-Jiki's is a new object (a token) that is created with the copiable characteristics of the creature."
    category: "copying"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_cards: ["Clone", "Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker"]
    key_rules: ["707.2", "707.3"]

  # Triggered Abilities
  - question: "When does a 'when this creature dies' trigger go on the stack?"
    expected_answer: "The trigger goes on the stack the next time a player would receive priority after the creature has been put into the graveyard. This is usually immediately after the state-based action that caused it to die."
    category: "triggered_abilities"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["603.2", "603.3"]

  - question: "If my Solemn Simulacrum dies in combat at the same time as my opponent's creature, do I draw a card before the opponent's 'dies' trigger resolves?"
    expected_answer: "Both 'dies' triggers go on the stack at the same time. Since it is your turn, your trigger is put on the stack first, followed by your opponent's. Your opponent's trigger will resolve first. You will draw your card after their trigger has resolved."
    category: "stack"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_cards: ["Solemn Simulacrum"]
    key_rules: ["603.3b"]

  - question: "If I miss a beneficial trigger (like gaining life), what happens?"
    expected_answer: "A missed trigger is generally considered forgotten. If caught within a reasonable time frame and the trigger does not have a choice, a judge may put it on the stack. If it has a choice (like 'you may draw a card'), the opponent decides if the trigger is put on the stack. In casual play, players usually allow it."
    category: "triggers"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["MTR 5.1"]

  # State-Based Actions
  - question: "What happens if I have 0 or negative life?"
    expected_answer: "Having 0 or less life causes you to lose the game as a state-based action. This happens immediately before any player would receive priority. You cannot cast a spell to gain life in response."
    category: "state_based_actions"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["704.5a"]

  - question: "Can a creature with 0 toughness be saved by a pump spell like Giant Growth?"
    expected_answer: "No. A creature with 0 or less toughness is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. This happens before any player receives priority to cast spells, so you never have the chance to cast Giant Growth to save it."
    category: "state_based_actions"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["704.5f", "117.5"]

  - question: "If two legendary permanents with the same name are on the battlefield, what happens?"
    expected_answer: "If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one and puts the rest into their owner's graveyards. This is a state-based action known as the 'legend rule'."
    category: "state_based_actions"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["704.5j"]

  # Replacement Effects
  - question: "If I control multiple replacement effects that could apply to the same event, who chooses the order?"
    expected_answer: "The player who is affected by the event or who controls the object affected by the event chooses the order in which to apply the replacement effects. This can be very strategic."
    category: "replacement_effects"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_rules: ["616.1"]

  - question: "What is the difference between a replacement effect and a triggered ability?"
    expected_answer: "A replacement effect (using words like 'instead' or 'as this enters') modifies an event *as it happens* and does not use the stack. A triggered ability (using 'when,' 'whenever,' or 'at') creates an ability on the stack *after* an event has happened."
    category: "replacement_effects"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["614", "603"]

  - question: "If I would draw a card while I control both a Laboratory Maniac and an Abundance, what happens?"
    expected_answer: "Since you control both replacement effects for drawing a card, you choose which one to apply. You can either replace the draw with Abundance's effect to look for a land or nonland, or you can apply Laboratory Maniac's effect, which, if you can't draw, causes you to win the game."
    category: "replacement_effects"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_cards: ["Laboratory Maniac", "Abundance"]
    key_rules: ["616.1"]

  # Multiplayer (Commander)
  - question: "What happens to permanents I control when I leave a multiplayer game?"
    expected_answer: "When you leave a multiplayer game, all permanents you own leave the game with you. Spells and abilities you control on the stack are exiled. Any effects that gave you control of other players' permanents end."
    category: "multiplayer"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["800.4a"]

  - question: "How does commander damage work?"
    expected_answer: "A player that has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game. This is a state-based action and is tracked separately for each commander."
    category: "multiplayer"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["903.10a"]

  - question: "If my commander is put into my graveyard, can I choose to put it back in the command zone?"
    expected_answer: "Yes. If your commander would be put into your hand, library, graveyard or exile from anywhere, you may choose to move it to the command zone instead. This is a state-based action that you can apply as it changes zones."
    category: "multiplayer"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["903.9"]

  - question: "Does the 'commander tax' apply if I cast my commander from my hand?"
    expected_answer: "No, the additional cost of two mana for each time you've cast your commander from the command zone only applies when casting it from the command zone. It does not apply if you cast it from your hand or any other zone."
    category: "multiplayer"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["903.8"]

  # Timing Restrictions
  - question: "Can I play a land during my opponent's turn?"
    expected_answer: "No, you can only play a land during one of your own main phases when you have priority and the stack is empty. You are also limited to one land play per turn unless an effect says otherwise."
    category: "timing"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["305.1"]

  - question: "When can I cast a sorcery?"
    expected_answer: "You can normally cast a sorcery only during your own turn, during a main phase, when the stack is empty, and when you have priority. Some effects can grant sorceries flash, allowing you to cast them any time you could cast an instant."
    category: "timing"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["307.1"]

  - question: "What does the 'Flash' keyword do?"
    expected_answer: "Flash is a keyword ability that allows you to cast a spell any time you could cast an instant. This means you can cast it during your opponent's turn, or in response to other spells or abilities."
    category: "keyword_abilities"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["702.8a"]

  # Layered Effects
  - question: "If a creature gets +1/+1 and then becomes a 2/2, what are its final stats?"
    expected_answer: "The creature will be a 3/3. Effects that set power and toughness (like making it a 2/2) are applied in layer 7b. Effects that modify power and toughness (like giving it +1/+1) are applied after that in layer 7c. So, it becomes a 2/2 first, and then gets +1/+1."
    category: "layers"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_rules: ["613.3", "613.4"]

  - question: "I enchant my Grizzly Bears (a 2/2) with an Aura that says 'Enchanted creature is blue'. Then my opponent plays a Blood Moon. What color is my creature?"
    expected_answer: "Your creature is blue. The effect changing its color from the Aura is applied in Layer 5 (Color-changing effects). Blood Moon's ability only affects nonbasic lands and does not interact with the creature's color."
    category: "layers"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_cards: ["Grizzly Bears", "Blood Moon"]
    key_rules: ["613.1e"]

  - question: "My creature is a 1/1. It is equipped with an artifact that gives it +2/+2. My opponent casts a spell making it a 0/1 until end of turn. Does it die?"
    expected_answer: "No, it will be a 2/3. The effect setting its power/toughness to 0/1 is applied in layer 7b. The equipment's +2/+2 bonus is applied in layer 7c. So it becomes a 0/1, then gets +2/+2, making it a 2/3."
    category: "layers"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_rules: ["613.3"]

  # Equipment and Auras
  - question: "What happens to equipment when the creature it's attached to dies?"
    expected_answer: "The equipment becomes unattached when the creature it was equipping leaves the battlefield. The equipment itself remains on the battlefield, where you can pay its equip cost again to attach it to another creature you control."
    category: "equipment"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["301.5c"]

  - question: "What happens to an aura when its enchanted permanent becomes an illegal target or is destroyed?"
    expected_answer: "If the permanent an Aura is attached to leaves the battlefield, the Aura is put into its owner's graveyard. Similarly, if the permanent is still on the battlefield but the Aura can no longer legally enchant it (e.g., due to protection), the Aura is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action."
    category: "auras"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["704.5m", "704.5n"]

  - question: "Can I respond to an 'equip' activation?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, activating an equip ability uses the stack and can be responded to. For example, if your opponent pays to equip a creature, you can cast an instant to destroy either the equipment or the target creature before the equip ability resolves."
    category: "equipment"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["702.6a"]

  - question: "If I gain control of an equipped creature, do I gain control of the equipment?"
    expected_answer: "No. You gain control of the creature, and the equipment remains attached to it, but your opponent still controls the equipment itself. This means they can activate the equipment's abilities, and if it becomes unattached, they can equip it to one of their own creatures."
    category: "control"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["301.5d"]
  - question: "How does 'double strike' work?"
    expected_answer: "A creature with double strike deals combat damage twice. It deals damage during the first strike combat damage step along with other first strike creatures, and then again during the regular combat damage step."
    category: "combat"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["702.4b"]

  - question: "If my opponent attacks with a creature, and I block with my creature, can I then sacrifice my blocking creature for an ability before damage is dealt?"
    expected_answer: "Yes, you can. After blockers are declared, there is a round of priority before the combat damage step. You can activate abilities at this time. The attacking creature remains blocked and, unless it has trample, will not deal combat damage to you."
    category: "combat"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["509.1h"]

  - question: "What does 'Protection from Red' actually do?"
    expected_answer: "Protection from a quality (like a color) prevents a permanent from being Damaged, Enchanted/Equipped, Blocked, or Targeted by anything with that quality. This is often remembered by the acronym DEBT."
    category: "keyword_abilities"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["702.16"]

  - question: "Does 'Protection from Creatures' stop a creature from being destroyed by a board wipe like Wrath of God?"
    expected_answer: "No. Wrath of God says 'Destroy all creatures.' It does not target, damage, block, or enchant anything, so protection does not apply. The creature will be destroyed."
    category: "protection"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_cards: ["Wrath of God"]
    key_rules: ["702.16e"]

  - question: "What is the difference between Shroud and Hexproof?"
    expected_answer: "A permanent with Shroud cannot be the target of *any* spells or abilities, including your own. A permanent with Hexproof cannot be the target of spells or abilities *your opponents* control, but you can still target it."
    category: "targeting"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["702.18a", "702.11c"]

  - question: "Do mana abilities use the stack?"
    expected_answer: "No, mana abilities do not use the stack and cannot be responded to. They resolve immediately. An ability is a mana ability if it doesn't target, could add mana to a player's mana pool, and isn't a loyalty ability."
    category: "mana"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["605.1a"]

  - question: "What happens when a spell with 'Split Second' is on the stack?"
    expected_answer: "While a spell with Split Second is on the stack, players cannot cast other spells or activate abilities that are not mana abilities. Once it resolves, players can act again."
    category: "keyword_abilities"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_rules: ["702.61a"]

  - question: "What happens when a player has to draw a card from an empty library?"
    expected_answer: "If a player is required to draw a card while their library is empty, they lose the game as a state-based action the next time a player would receive priority."
    category: "state_based_actions"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["704.5b"]

  - question: "How many poison counters cause a player to lose the game?"
    expected_answer: "A player with ten or more poison counters loses the game as a state-based action. This is an alternative win condition for strategies using the 'Infect' or 'Toxic' keywords."
    category: "state_based_actions"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["704.5c"]

  - question: "What happens to a planeswalker if its loyalty is reduced to 0?"
    expected_answer: "A planeswalker with zero loyalty counters is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action. This happens immediately and cannot be responded to."
    category: "planeswalkers"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["704.5i"]

  - question: "If Rest in Peace is on the battlefield, will a creature's 'dies' ability trigger?"
    expected_answer: "No. Rest in Peace creates a replacement effect that exiles cards that would go to the graveyard. Since the creature card never hits the graveyard, it never technically 'dies', so 'dies' triggers will not occur."
    category: "replacement_effects"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_cards: ["Rest in Peace"]
    key_rules: ["614.6", "700.4"]

  - question: "If I cast a creature for its Evoke cost, do I still get its 'enters the battlefield' ability?"
    expected_answer: "Yes. When you cast a spell for its Evoke cost, the creature enters the battlefield, and its ETB ability triggers. Then, a separate triggered ability from Evoke triggers, requiring you to sacrifice it. You can respond to the sacrifice trigger while the ETB trigger is on the stack."
    category: "keyword_abilities"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["702.74a"]

  - question: "How do Vehicles work?"
    expected_answer: "Vehicles are artifacts that are not initially creatures. They have a 'Crew' activated ability. By tapping any number of untapped creatures you control with total power equal to or greater than the crew number, the Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn."
    category: "card_types"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["301.7a", "702.122a"]

  - question: "What happens to a Saga after its final chapter ability resolves?"
    expected_answer: "After the final chapter's ability resolves (or leaves the stack in any way), the controller of the Saga sacrifices it. This is a state-based action."
    category: "card_types"
    difficulty: "basic"
    key_rules: ["714.4"]

  - question: "If I cast the Adventure part of a creature card, where does the card go?"
    expected_answer: "After you cast an Adventure spell, if it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in any other way, you exile it instead of putting it into your graveyard. You can then cast the creature from exile."
    category: "card_types"
    difficulty: "intermediate"
    key_rules: ["708.8"]

  - question: "I use Act of Treason to take my opponent's creature. Then I cast a spell giving it Hexproof. Who can target it?"
    expected_answer: "You are the creature's controller for the turn. Hexproof prevents opponents of the creature's *controller* from targeting it. So your opponent, the creature's owner, cannot target it. You and your other opponents can."
    category: "control"
    difficulty: "advanced"
    key_cards: ["Act of Treason"]
    key_rules: ["702.11c"]

  - question: "If I copy a kicked spell, is the copy kicked?"
    expected_answer: "Yes. When you copy a spell on the stack, you copy the choices made when it was cast, including whether it was kicked and how many times. You don't get to make new choices for the copy."
    category: "copying"
    difficulty: "intermediate"

Then, Blood Moon makes all nonbasic lands into just Mountains. Because Urborg's effect is applied first due to dependency, it makes a land a Swamp, then Blood Moon's effect overwrites that, making it a Mountain. Your nonbasics will be non-Swamp Mountains."

  - question: "I control Opalescence and Humility. What are my other enchantments?"
    expected_answer: "This is a complex layer interaction with a dependency loop. Opalescence makes enchantments into creatures based on their mana cost. Humility makes creatures into 1/1s and removes their abilities. Because their effects apply in the same layer (4, 6, and 7b) and are dependent on each other, they are applied in timestamp order. If Opalescence entered first, your other enchantments become creatures, then Humility makes them 1/1s with no abilities. If Humility entered first, it removes Opalescence's ability before it can apply, so your other enchantments remain as normal enchantments."

    expected_answer: "Yes, you can. Turning a creature face up via its morph ability is a special action that does not use the stack. Split Second only prevents players from casting spells or activating abilities that are not mana abilities. Since morph is neither, you are allowed to do it."

The player who controls the affected object (the creature) gets to choose which replacement effect to apply. If they choose your Leyline, it's exiled. If they choose Rest in Peace, it's exiled.

  - question: "My opponent controls a Chalice of the Void with one counter. I cast a spell with Suspend that has a mana value of 1 (like Ancestral Vision). When the last time counter is removed, does Chalice counter it?"
    expected_answer: "No. When you cast a spell from suspend, you are casting it without paying its mana cost. However, its mana value is still what is printed on the card (0 for Ancestral Vision, 1 for something like Rift Bolt). Because you are casting a spell with mana value 1, Chalice of the Void will trigger and counter it."

  - question: "What is the result of using a 'text-changing effect' like Mind Bend on a card like Story Circle, changing 'red' to 'blue', if there is a 'color-changing effect' making a red source blue?"
    expected_answer: "Text-changing effects are applied in Layer 3. Color-changing effects are applied in Layer 5. The text of Story Circle is changed to 'protection from blue' first.

  - question: "If I am at 1 life and I cast a spell that causes me to gain 2 life and lose 2 life (like a resolved Swords to Plowshares on my own creature), do I lose the game?"
    expected_answer: "No. All parts of a spell's effect happen sequentially as written. If the spell says 'You gain 2 life, then you lose 2 life', you will go to 3 life, then down to 1 life.
